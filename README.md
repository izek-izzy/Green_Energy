# Green_Energy
GreenFutures is an environmental advocacy group committed to accelerating the 
transition towards renewable energy sources to mitigate the impacts of climate
change. They aim to educate the public on the importance of sustainable energy
solutions and lobby for policies that support green energy adoption. 
The organisation has approached you to develop a dynamic website that serves as an
educational platform and a hub for community action. The website should include the
following: 
 
 Home Page: A visually compelling landing page with a clean, modern design.
It should feature a responsive navigation bar, a brief introduction to
GreenFutures, a "Join Us" pop-up form (First Name, Last Name, Email, and
password), an integrated news feed from their official news outlet, and a
carousel showcasing renewable energy projects. Social media links, privacy
policy, and cookie consent should be clearly accessible. 
 About Renewable Energy: This page will offer educational content on various
renewable energy sources, their benefits, and how they combat climate
change. 
 Get Involved: A page detailing how visitors can support or join renewable
energy initiatives, including donation options and volunteer sign-up. 
 Contact Us: An interactive form allowing visitors to reach out with questions,
suggestions, or support. 
 Latest News: Featuring articles, updates on renewable energy advancements,
and GreenFutures' projects. 
 Policy Advocacy: Highlighting the group's efforts in lobbying for renewable
energy policies and ways the public can support these initiatives. 
 Educational Resources: Providing downloadable resources, infographics,
and videos on renewable energy topics. 
The website must support user registration and login, with a security feature that locks
users out after three failed login attempts, allowing reset after three minutes. 
The website should be mobile-responsive, and accessible, and include a cookie
notification pop-up. A database is required for managing user accounts and tracking
donations. 
You will create a web application for users to register, manage their information, and
interact with the database to create, query, update, and delete records. 
This project requires the use of PHP, MySQL, and JavaScript, including a web service
for handling donations.
